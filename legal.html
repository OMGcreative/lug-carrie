                                    <p>If lawyers designed a bicycle, it’d have six wheels, roll bars, a flashing red light and you wouldn’t know which way went forward and which was back. It wouldn’t be any fun to ride, but you sure would be safe.</p>
                                    <p>We knew this when we asked some lawyers to write Lug &amp; Carrie’s Terms and Conditions (Ts&amp;Cs). They did a wonderful job, but we like to keep things simple, and our Ts&amp;Cs are kind of like that bike with six wheels.</p>
                                    <p>So we’ve pulled out the things that we get asked about a lot, and provided them below. We still recommend you read through the full version.</p>
                                    <p>Our lawyers just slowly rode up on their bike and yelled at us to make sure to note that even though we’ve provided this summary, it doesn’t change any of the rights and responsibilities that are set forth in the full version of the Ts&amp;Cs.</p><h3><strong>Important Details About A Lug &amp; Carrie Subscription</strong></h3><h4>First Payment</h4>
                                    <p>Your first subscription payment will be made on the day you receive your bike, and it covers the first week of your subscription.</p>

                                    <h4>Payment Frequency</h4>
                                    <p>Subscription payments will be automatically deducted from your bank account on a weekly basis.</p>

                                    <h4>Maintenance</h4>
                                    <p>We like to service our eBikes every 2,000km or as required to keep them running tip top for you.&nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>We may contact you after a few months to check your odometer for us.</p>
                                    <p>When we determine that it is time for a service, we’ll let you know and will ask that you bring your bike to our shop.&nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>All maintenance costs are included with your subscription, so no need to worry about payment.</p>

                                    <h4>Repairs</h4>
                                    <p>If your bike breaks down, we will fix it for you.</p>
                                    <p>If there is a breakdown, it is your responsibility to bring the bike to our shop to be fixed, and to pick it up when repairs have been&nbsp;completed.</p>
                                    <p>If the bike is not rideable, Rider Rescue can be used to bring the bike to the shop. Check out our <a href="https://www.lug-carrie.com/post/the-lug-carrie-guide-to-breakdowns" target="_blank">Lug &amp; Carrie Guide to Breakdowns</a> for the details on how that works.</p>
                                    <p>We will make every effort to get the bike fixed as soon as possible. When you bring the bike in, we will let you know how long service will take.</p>
                                    <p>Repairs are included with your subscription, so no need to worry about payment, unless you are responsible for what needs to be fixed. In that case &hellip;</p>

                                    <h4>Damage and Theft</h4>
                                    <p>Stuff happens, so we’ve covered the bikes for damage and theft. In general, for damage and theft, the maximum amount you are responsible for paying is <strong>$500</strong>.</p>
                                    <p>In the case that the bike is stolen, you will be responsible for paying us $500.</p>
                                    <p>In the case of theft, we will need you to report the incident to the police, get a written police report, and provide the report to us. You will also need to return all the keys to us.</p>
                                    <p>In the case any of the accessories are stolen, we will charge you for the cost to replace the stolen accessory, to a maximum of $500.</p>
                                    <p>If the bike is damaged and needs to be fixed, we will charge you the cost of parts and labour for the repair, to a maximum of $500. This limit may not apply if you did something inappropriate with your bike, like taking it cliff diving.&nbsp;</p>
                                    
                                    <h4>Your new bike isn’t necessarily a new bike</h4>
                                    <p>While it is possible that your subscription will include a brand new bike, it is also possible that it will be one that was living with another subscriber and has been returned to us. This is ok, because we keep the bikes fully maintained and in top condition, and our subscribers take great care of their bikes.&nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>If you want the option to purchase your bike let us know and you can take advantage of our Guaranteed Purchase Pricing.</p>

                                    <h4>Swapping</h4>
                                    <p>We are happy for you to swap your bike for a different model, or swap your accessories for different ones, if something isn’t working for you.</p>
                                    <p>Accessory swaps are free. </p>
                                    <p>With your bike, you can swap one time for free in the first 28-days of your subscription. After that, there’s a fee outlined in the fee section below.&nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>Your subscription fee will be adjusted to reflect the swapped items.</p>
                                    
                                    <h4>Storing Your Bike</h4>
                                    <p>We expect that you will store your bike under cover, not visible from the street, and not in public (i.e., not locked up on the street) each night, our preference being a garage or a shed. Storing in a public area like an open air garage or communal bike area is fine as long as they are secure. Regardless, in these locations, and any location that isn't secure, the bike must be locked up using the frame lock and chained to something solid, with the alarm engaged. These areas are more secure than being out in the open, but are still accessible to thieves.</p>
                                    <h4>Ending a Subscription</h4>
                                    <p>A subscription is subject to a 28-day cancellation period, meaning you need to let us know 28 days in advance of when you would like your subscription to end.&nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>At the conclusion of your subscription, you need to return the bike to us.</p>
                                    <p>Your bike comes with a charger, a key and a chain lock, and any accessories that you have elected to include with your subscription. All must be returned to us at the conclusion of your subscription.</p>
                                    
                                    <h4>Fees</h4>
                                    <p>We’ve tried to keep all costs to a minimum by including all the important stuff like maintenance and roadside assistance, but nonetheless there are some fees that we think you should know about.</p><h5>The following applies to customers in Melbourne:</h5>
